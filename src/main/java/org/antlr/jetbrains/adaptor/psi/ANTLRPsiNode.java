/** This class represents an internal, non-leaf "composite" PSI
 *  node. The term "ANTLRPsiNode" is somewhat of a misnomer as it's
 *  really just a PSI node but make sure that getChildren() acts as I
 *  would expect, returning all children.
 *
 *  The IElementType of the associated ASTNode's will be {@link
 *  RuleIElementType} and the ASTNode's associated with LeafElement's
 *  are {@link TokenIElementType}. The only exception is when parsing
 *  snippets of code. In that case, Intellij calls
 *  ParserDefinition.createElement() with a TokenIElementType (usually
 *  identifier) as the root of the generated PSI tree. So, when
 *  looking for an ID, you might get a tree like (ID (expr (primary
 *  ID))). Weird but whatever. The root ID is an ANTLRPsiNode and the
 *  leaf ID is an ANTLRPsiLeafNode.
 *
 *  I've come to the conclusion that it's much easier to build plug-ins
 *  when you have PSI trees with heterogeneous types. I typically make
 *  subclasses of ANTLRPsiNode for each kind of declaration for use with
 *  renaming, find usages, and jump to declaration.
