# jetbrains
A library to support the use of ANTLR grammars in jetbrains IDEs for building custom languages.

 All I have is documentation at this point in this repository, but I will be adding code as I can generalize what I've done. I started out using the internal "PSI" trees that Intellij is based upon but I don't like their parsing and lexing mechanism. That makes it hard for me to use their built-in PSI trees, which are fine, but still different than what ANTLR wants to build. The [ANTLR plug-in](https://github.com/antlr/intellij-plugin-v4) itself was my first and it converted ANTLR trees to PSI trees but it required a very complicated adapter from ANTLR recognizers to what intellij needs. It is also very fragile and I can't get it to work right so I built my [StringTemplate plug-in](https://github.com/antlr/jetbrains-plugin-st4) using ANTLR trees and recognizers exclusively. His language is semi-difficult because it is actually two languages. At the outermost level it is a group file (of templates) but each template definition has an embedded language of StringTemplate itself.  When I can, I will abstract out the generic code that makes it easy to build ANTLR-based language plug-ins for jetbrains stuff.
